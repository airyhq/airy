The Airy Core Platform is an open source, fully-featured, production ready
messaging platform.
With Airy you can process conversational data from a variety of sources:

 - **Facebook**
 - **WhatsApp**
 - **Google's Business Messages**
 - **SMS**
 - **Website Chat Plugins**
 - **Twilio**
 - **Your own conversational channels**

You can then use Airy to:

 - **Unify your messaging channels**
 - **Stream your conversational data wherever you want**
 - **Integrate with different NLP frameworks**
 - **Mediate open requests with Agents via our messaging UI**
 - **Analyze your conversations**

Since Airy's infrastructure is built around Apache Kafka, it can process a
large amount of conversations and messages simultaneously and stream the
relevant conversational data to wherever you need it.

[announcement blog post](https://airy.co/blog/what-we-open-sourced).

## Getting started

You can run the Airy Core Platform locally by running the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/airyhq/airy
$ cd airy
$ ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap installation requires
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). If they are not
found, the script will attempt to install them for you. Check out our [test
deployment guide](/docs/docs/guides/airy-core-in-test-env.md) for detailed information.

## Components

The Airy Core Platform contains the following components:

- An ingestion platform that heavily relies on [Apache
  Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) to process incoming webhook data from
  different sources. We make sense of the data and reshape it into source
  independent contacts, conversations, and messages (see our
  [glossary](/docs/docs/glossary.md) for formal definitions).

- An [API](/docs/docs/api/http.md) to manage the data sets the platform
  handles.

- A webhook integration server that allows its users to programmatically
  participate in conversations by sending messages (the webhook integration
  exposes events users can "listen" to and react programmatically.)

- A WebSocket server that allows clients to receive near real-time updates about
  data flowing through the system.

## Organization of the Repository

This [monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) contains all the
code and tooling required to run the Airy Core Platform.

Here is a quick overview of how the repository is organized:

- `backend`

  This directory contains the code of the ingestion platform (in the
  subdirectory `backend/sources`), the code of the webhook server (in the
  subdirectory `backend/webhook`), and the code of the API endpoints (in the
  subdirectory `backend/api`).

- `frontend`

  This directory contains the code of a demo epplication which showcases
  the feature of the platform.

- `infrastructure`

  This directory contains the code that creates the infrastructure (we rely
  heavily on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) as a runtime for our
  applications).

- `tools`

  This directory contains the tooling we wrote to support our
  [Bazel](https://bazel.build) builds. Furthermore, it contains some support
  tooling for our infrastructure.

- `scripts`

  This directory contains a variety of utility scripts.

If you wish to learn more about a specific project, refer to the
`README.md` in the corresponding subdirectory.

## Design Principles

The Airy Core Platform is built using a few guiding principles. An introduction
to these principles is essential to navigate the code base with ease. You can
read more about it [here](/docs/docs/guidelines/design-principles.md)
