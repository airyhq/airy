Airy Core is an is an open-source streaming app framework to train ML models and supply them with historical and real-time data. With Airy you can process data from a variety of
sources:

- **Facebook**
- **WhatsApp**
- **Google's Business Messages**
- **SMS**
- **Website Chat Plugins, like our own open source Live Chat**
- **Twilio**
- **Any source you want with Custom Connectors**

You can then use Airy to:

- **Join historical and real-time data in the stream to create smarter ML and AI applications.**
- **Build real-time data pipelines and make real-time data universally accessible with our open-source streaming app framework.**
- **Standardize complex data ingestion and consume data directly from Kafka. Stream it directly to standard and customized applications, using pre-built, easily configured connectors.**
- **Significantly simplify deployment and reduce development times and increase the robustness of your infrastructure and apps.**

Since Airy's infrastructure is built around Apache Kafka, it can process a large
amount of events simultaneously and stream the relevant
real-time and historical data to wherever you need it.

## Components

![Airy_Explainer_Components_Readme (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12533283/112460661-6de3fe80-8d5f-11eb-8274-8446fbfcf5c8.png)

Airy Core comes with all the components you need to stream historical and real-time data.

- üí¨ Pre-built and easily configurable [connectors](https://airy.co/docs/core/connectors/sources/introduction)

By ingesting all real-time events and continuously processing, aggregating and joining them in the stream, development time can be significantly reduced. Through integrations with pre-built and easily configured connectors, events are consumed from any source, including business systems such as ERP/CRM, conversational sources, third party APIs. Airy also comes with an SDK to build custom connectors to any source.

- ‚ö°[APIs](https://airy.co/docs/core/api/introduction) to access your data

An [API](https://airy.co/docs/core/api/introduction) to access
data with blazing fast HTTP endpoints.

- üîå[WebSockets](https://airy.co/docs/core/api/websocket) to power real-time applications

A [WebSocket server](https://airy.co/docs/core/api/websocket) that allows
clients to receive near real-time updates about data flowing through the system.

- üé£[Webhook](https://airy.co/docs/core/api/webhook) to listen to events and create actionable workflows

A webhook integration server that allows its users to create actionable workflows (the webhook integration
exposes events users can "listen" to and react programmatically.)

- üíé[UI](https://airy.co/docs/core/ui/overview) to access the data and the control center through a browser

No-code interfaces to manage and control Airy, your connectors and your streams.
