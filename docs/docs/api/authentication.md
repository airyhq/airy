<TLDR>

To start using the API, you need to **authenticate first**.

</TLDR>

In order to communicate with the Airy Core API, you need either a valid, short-lived
[JWT](https://jwt.io/) or a system API token.

The jwt can be obtained by calling the login endpoint [login](#login), while the API token needs to be
applied as a cluster [configuration](getting-started/installation/configuration.md).

To use either token type for authentication you can set them as a value on the [Bearer Authorization header](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750#section-2.1) when making requests.

## Login

As the purpose of this endpoint is to obtain valid JWT tokens, it
does not require a valid token to be present in the headers.

`POST /users.login`

**Sample request**

```json5
{
  "email": "grace@example.com",
  "password": "avalidpassword"
}
```

**Sample response**

```json
{
  "id": "424242-4242-42-4242-4242",
  "first_name": "Grace",
  "last_name": "Hopper",
  "token": "JWT_TOKEN"
}
```
