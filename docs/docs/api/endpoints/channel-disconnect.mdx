A synchronous endpoint that makes a request to the source to disconnect the
channel. It marks the channel as disconnected and deletes the auth token.

This action is idempotent, so if the channel is disconnected, the request
returns status code `202`. If the channel is unknown, the request returns status
code `400`.

**Sample request**

```json5
{
  channel_id: 'uuid',
}
```
