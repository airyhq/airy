After you created a Twilio phone number you must [point its webhook
integration](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/tutorials/how-to-receive-and-reply-java#configure-your-webhook-url)
to your running Airy Core instance.

Next call the Platform API:

```
POST /channels.twilio.sms.connect
```

- `phone_number` The phone number as listed in your [Twilio
  dashboard](https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers/). It must _not_ contain
  spaces and must include the country code.
- `name` Custom name for the connected phone number
- `image_url` Custom image URL

**Sample request**

```json5
{
  "phone_number": "+491234567",
  "name": "SMS for receipts",
  "image_url": "https://example.com/custom-image.jpg" // optional
}
```

**Sample response**
