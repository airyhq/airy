`POST /messages.send`

Sends a message to a conversation and returns a payload. Whatever is put on the
`message` field will be forwarded "as-is" to the source's message endpoint. Therefore,
the payload will look differently for each source. Refer to each [source's documentation](/sources/introduction)
to see learn how to send text, media, and many more message types.
