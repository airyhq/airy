Interact with your Airy Core via **HTTP Endpoints**, **WebSockets** or **Webhooks**.

</Highlighter>

This documents offers a high-level overview of the different parts that
compose the Airy Core API.

Once you connect Airy Core to a [source](/getting-started/glossary.md#source), the
platform will immediately start consuming conversational data and store it in
its streaming data platform. Airy Core exposes three different ways of
interacting with data:

- an [HTTP API](/api/endpoints/introduction.md)
- A [WebSocket server](/api/websocket.md)
- A [Webhook integration](/api/webhook.md)
