## Introduction

Sometimes code is not enough, this is why Airy comes with two different UIs ready for you and your teams to use. Different from the [Chat Plugin](sources/chat-plugin.md) that is open and visible for everyone the UI application is embeeded in the system and it is just for your own use and it offers many features that makes your life and the life of your team easier. 

You can use the Inbox to reply to conversations from different sources like Whatsapp, SMS, Facebook or Google Business Messages. You can also reply to conversations created by the [Chat Plugin](sources/chat-plugin.md). You can create tags and add those tags to the conversations to make filtering easier or even create teams that just have access to specific tagged conversations.

You can get to know better our UI in the next sections:

- [Setup](ui)
- [Inbox](ui)
- [Tags](ui)
- [Teams & Routing](ui)
- [UI Components](ui)
