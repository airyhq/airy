Airy’s Inbox gives you an UI for all your conversations.

See all conversations from the sources you connected, no matter if they come via the Live Chat Plugin, Facebook Messenger, Google’s Business Messages, SMS, WhatsApp or a custom source.

The inbox supports not only text messages but a variety of different message types.

**Send & Receive Messages**

You and your team members can use the inbox to receive and send messages from different sources.
Each of these sources have different character limits.

**Facebook Templates**

A template is a simple structured message that can include a title, subtitle, image, and up to three buttons.
Airy’s Inbox supports all templates that Facebook supports, from Generic Templates to Button Templates.

**Google’s Rich Cards**

Rich Cards are Google’s templates: a simple structured message that can include a title, description, media and up to 4 suggested replies (buttons).
Airy’s Inbox supports all Google’s Rich Cards variants from Rich Cards to Carousels.

**Render Templates for Chat Plugin**

Airy’s Live Chat Plugin supports templates too. The template payload is the same as for Google Rich Cards.
This enables you and your teams to interact with your website visitors in a richer way, and also enables chat bots in the templates.
