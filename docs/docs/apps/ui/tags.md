**Introduction**

Tags are words, or combinations of words, you can use to add more context to conversations and contacts.

Tags provide you with an unlimited amount of flexibility to manage and customize your conversational workflow.

Here are the ways you can create and use tags:

- Use the Tag API to create them programmatically
- Your users can create them manually directly in conversations
- They can be created in the Tag Manager

<img alt="Demo Tags"
