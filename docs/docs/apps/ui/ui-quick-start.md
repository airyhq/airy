**Step 1: Create a user**

Now that Airy is installed you first need to create a user. A user enables you to then login to the UI and access the inbox and other features.

SIDE NOTE: We don’t have a good UI for Request/Response yet, above might do, but here how Stripe does it, if you could quickly implement something like that it would be cool too:

**Step 2: Open UI**

Now that you have a user you can use it to simply login into the UI. For that just open http://ui.airy.

**Step 3: Login**

Using the credentials you created in Step 1, login to your Airy UI.

:tada: Success!
You are now in the UI!

SIDE NOTE: Time to reuse the success info box from https://docs.airy.co/cli/installation, could you make it nicer by:

- Making the Headline Bold and capitalized: SUCCESS!
- add a space between the emoji and SUCCESS!
- make the subtitle “You are now in the UI!” also bold
