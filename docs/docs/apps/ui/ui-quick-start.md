**Step 1: Create a user**

Now that Airy is installed you first need to create a user. A user enables you to then login to the UI and access the inbox and other features.

**Step 2: Open UI**

Now that you have a user you can use it to simply login into the UI. For that just open http://ui.airy.

**Step 3: Login**

Using the credentials you created in Step 1, login to your Airy UI.

:tada: Success!
You are now in the UI!
