There are 2 options to connect this connector's channel to your instance:

- you can send an API request (using [curl](https://curl.se/) or an API platform such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com))
- you can use the [Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction) to connect and manage the channel in just a few clicks

We cover both options in this section.
