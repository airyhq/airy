A component is a Helm Chart that can be installed on an Airy Cluster in order to extend its functionality.

Components can be characterized by the functionality they enable:

1. UI Components that provide new user interfaces in Airy.
2. Connector Components that connect one or more third-party services with Airy to exchange data. 
3. API Components that expose additional endpoints to Airy.

:::note

A Component can provide multiple functions (e.g., Connector & UI or UI & API) but usually has a single primary function. You can find a more detailed description of a specific component in the `description.yaml` file of the component in our [airy-components](https://github.com/airyhq/airy-components) respository.
