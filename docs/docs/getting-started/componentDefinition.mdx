A component is a Helm Chart that is installed on an Airy Cluster, and extends Airy's functionality in up to three ways.

1. UI Components provide new user interfaces in Airy
2. Connector Components connect to one or more third-party services to exchange data with Airy. 
3. API Components expose additional endpoints to Airy.

:::note

A Component can provide multiple functions (e.g., Connector & UI or UI & API) but usually has a single primary function. You can find a more detailed description of a specific component in the `description.yaml` file of the component in our [airy-components](https://github.com/airyhq/airy-components) respository.
