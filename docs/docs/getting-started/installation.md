<TLDR>

You can install Airy Core from **many possible installation options**, locally
or in the cloud.

</TLDR>

We recommend to [install](/cli/installation.md) the Airy CLI first which will
aid you in the process of installing and managing your Airy Core instance. It is easy to install and works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
