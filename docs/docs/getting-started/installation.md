<TLDR>

You can install Airy Core from **many possible installation options**, locally
or in the cloud.

</TLDR>

### Command Line Interface

The [Airy CLI](/cli/introduction.md) is a developer tool to help you **build**, **test**, and **manage** Airy directly from your terminal.

We recommend to [install](/cli/installation.md) the Airy CLI first which will
aid you in the process of installing and managing your Airy Core instance.

It is easy to install and works on macOS, Windows, and Linux.
