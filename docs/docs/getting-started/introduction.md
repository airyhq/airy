## What Airy is used for

With Airy Core you can process data from a variety of sources:

- Facebook Messenger
- WhatsApp Business API
- Google's Business Messages
- SMS
- Website Chat Plugins
- Any source you want with Custom Connectors

You can then use Airy Core to:

- Join historical and real-time data in the stream to create smarter ML and AI applications.
- Build real-time data pipelines and make real-time data universally accessible with our open-source streaming app framework.
- Standardize complex data ingestion and consume data directly from Kafka. Stream it directly to standard and customized applications, using pre-built, easily configured connectors.
- Significantly simplify deployment and reduce development times and increase the robustness of your infrastructure and apps.

Since Airy's infrastructure is built around Apache Kafka,
it can process a large amount of events simultaneously and stream the relevant real-time
and historical data to wherever you need it.
