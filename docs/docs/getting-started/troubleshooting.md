<TLDR>

There are 2 ways to get help quickly: **Community Support** and **Enterprise
Support** by the founding engineers.

</TLDR>

Airy Core is free and open-source for users who wish to self-host the platform.
That doesn't mean that you are alone with your problems.

## Community Support

Airy’s [Community Slack](https://airy.co/community) is a great place to reach
out for help. Our community and Core developers are often logged in and ready to
answer questions.
