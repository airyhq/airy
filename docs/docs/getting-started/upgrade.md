<TLDR>

Upgrade an existing installation of Airy Core.

</TLDR>

## Upgrade your CLI

In order to upgrade your Airy Core instance, first you need to upgrade your Airy CLI, depending on your [installation method](/cli/introduction#step-2-install-the-airy-cli).

You can check the current version of your Airy CLI with the `airy version` command:

```
airy version
Version: 0.29.0, GitCommit: b47d7e46c884a45c4c2169f626ebd0ff9ff6ee8e
```

## Upgrade your Airy Core instance

:::warning

The upgrade of your Airy Core cluster will lead to downtime. Usually it takes seconds, but in case there is a migration or a reset of some of the streaming apps, this process might take longer, depending on the amount of data you have.

Before you proceed, refer to the Release documentation for any upgrade notes or steps.

:::

The upgrade process will not delete any of the persistent data that is kept inside the Kafka cluster. Use the `airy upgrade` command to perform the upgrade of your Airy Core instance. Run `airy upgrade` to return information about your current Airy Core version and the latest version available. You will be prompted to proceed with the upgrade (omit this prompt by using the `--approve` flag).

```sh
$ airy upgrade
CLI version:  0.29.0
Current Airy Core version:  0.28.0
New Airy Core version:  0.29.0

Are you sure that you want to proceed? [Y/y]
Y
```

:::note

You need to be inside an Airy Core workspace directory to run the command.

You can overwrite the path by specifying the `--workspace` flag, for example:

`airy upgrade --workspace ~/.airy/production`.

:::

The upgrade will continue until complete. You will receive a notification to confirm that the upgrade was successful. The version will be updated inside the Kubernetes cluster and in your local `airy.yaml` file.

```
Upgrading the helm charts of Airy Core...
Applying config from the configuration file.

Writing the new version into the configuration file.

```

## Upgrade using Helm

If you used Helm to deploy `Airy Core`, you can upgrade with the `helm upgrade` command:

```sh
VERSION=$(curl -L -s https://airy-core-binaries.s3.amazonaws.com/stable.txt)
helm upgrade airy https://airy-core-helm-charts.s3.amazonaws.com/stable/airy-${VERSION}.tgz --values ./airy.yaml
```

## Cleanup the upgrade

The upgrade will create few additional resources (Kubernetes jobs and configMaps) which are not deleted automatically, so that there is a better insight of what happened during the upgrade.
To cleanup those resources, run:

```sh
kubectl delete pods -l job-name=helm-runner
kubectl delete configmap -l core.airy.co/upgrade="true"
kubectl delete job -l core.airy.co/upgrade="true"
kubectl delete job -l core.airy.co/upgrade="post-upgrade"
```

## Rollback

In case the upgrade fails, first you can inspect the reason for the failure by running this command:

```
kubectl logs -l job-name=helm-runner
```

After that, you can rollback to your previous Airy Core version. Clean-up the upgrade resources as instructed in the previous section and run:

```sh
helm rollback airy
airy config apply
kubectl delete pod -l app=airy-controller
```
