The Airy Core Platform follows a scheduled release process: we release a new
version every two-weeks. This approach allows us to ship smaller releases which
ease the risk of breaking changes and brings new features and bug-fixes to our
users in a timely manner.

Here's an outline of the process:

- We branch from `develop` unless it's a hot-fix (we'd use `main` in that case)
- Once release days comes, we execute the following steps:
  - We create a release branch from `develop`
  - The branch must follow the convention `release/x.y.z`
  - We test our release and any additional hot-fix is committed directly to the release branch
  - Once we're satisfied with the release, we update the `VERSION` file with the current release number
  - We merge the release branch into `main`, tag `main` following the same naming convention and push to `main`
  - We merge the release branch back into `develop`
  - We archive cards in the done column of the [work in progress](https://github.com/airyhq/airy/projects/1) board
  - We announce the release!
