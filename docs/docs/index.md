The Airy Core Platform is a fully-featured, production ready messaging platform
that allows its user to process messaging data from a variety of sources (like
facebook messenger or google business messages). The core platform contains the
following components:

- An ingestion platform that heavily relies on [Apache
  Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) to process incoming webhook data from
  different sources. We make sense of the data and reshape it into source
  independent contacts, conversations, and messages (see our
  [glossary](glossary.md) for formal definitions).

- An [HTTP api](api/http.md) to manage the data sets the platform
  handles.

- A webhook integration server that allows its users to programmatically
  participate in conversations by sending messages (the webhook integration
  exposes events users can "listen" to and react programmatically.)

- A WebSocket server that allows clients to receive near real-time updates about
  data flowing through the system.

## Getting started

You can run the Airy Core Platform locally by running the following commands:

```sh
$ git clone -b main https://github.com/airyhq/airy
$ cd airy
$ ./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

The bootstrap installation requires
[Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads). If they are not
found, the script will attempt to install them for you. Check out our [user
guide](user-guide.md) for detailed information.

### 1. Connecting a chat plugin source

The chat plugin source is well suited for a first integration because it does not require any configuration.

Once you [signed up](api/http#signup), you must [log in](api/http#login) so you can obtain a valid JWT token for the up-coming API calls:

```
$ token=$(echo $(curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
"{ \
\"email\":\"grace@example.com\", \
\"password\":\"the_answer_is_42\" \
}" api.airy/users.login) | jq -r '.token')
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: $token" -d \
"{ \
    \"source\": \"chat_plugin\", \
    \"source_channel_id\": \"my-chat-channel-1\", \
    \"name\": \"chat plugin source\"
}" api.airy/channels.connect
```




The id from the response is the channel id, note it down as it's required in the next steps.

### 2. Sending messages with the chat plugin

Pass the `channel_id` as query parameter when opening the demo page in your browser. This will authenticate the chat plugin and enable you to send messages immediately: 

```
http://chatplugin.airy/example.html?channel_id=<channel_id>
```

You can now type a message in the text box and send it ðŸŽ‰ 

### 3. Receiving messages in the core platform

To see how messages are flowing through the system, you can now [list conversations](api/http.md#list-conversations) for the channel you just created which should return the message you just sent.

```
$ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: $token" -d \
"{ \
    \"filter\": \
        { \
            \"channel_ids\": [\"<channel_id>\"] \
        } \
}" api.airy/conversations.list | jq .
```

You can also consume the messages directly from the Kafka `application.communication.messages` topic:

```
cd infrastructure && vagrant ssh
k exec -it airy-cp-kafka-0 -- /bin/bash
kafka-console-consumer \
--bootstrap-server airy-cp-kafka:9092 \
--topic application.communication.messages \
--from-beginning
```
