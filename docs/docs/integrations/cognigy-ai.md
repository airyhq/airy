<TLDR>

Cognigy.AI was developed in order to overcome most of the challenges in building conversational AIs. One of the unique aspects of the platform, is the bundling of - conversational AI related resources - in a user-friendly interface.

- From the [Cognigy.AI documentation](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/platform-overview/)

</TLDR>

Integrating [Cognigy.AI](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/platform-overview/) with your Airy Core instance enables you to leverage its conversational AI capabilities on all your instance's channels.

When [Cognigy.AI](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/platform-overview/) is integrated with an Airy Core instance, Airy Core will forward the messages to the Cognigy.AI agent's installation, which will respond to the Airy Core API according to its conversation flow.

- A running Airy Core installation (refer to the [Get
  Started section](getting-started/installation/introduction.md))

## Step 1: Create a Cognigy.AI Live Agent

The first step is to create an account on the [Cognigy.AI platform](https://www.cognigy.com/products/cognigy-ai). Next, create a Live Agent: this [guide](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/resources/agents/agents/) from the Cognigy.AI documentation details the necessary steps.

## Step 2: Create a Cognigy.AI Flow

<TLDR>

A conversation Flow describes the logic and sequence of a conversation. It defines what your Virtual Agent (VA) can do and how it handles the interaction.

- From the [Cognigy.AI documentation](https://support.cognigy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014524180-Design-a-Flow-and-add-a-Message#-3-tell-the-va-what-to-say-0-2)

</TLDR>

The second step is to create a Flow on the Cognigy.AI platform: this [guide](https://support.cognigy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014524180-Design-a-Flow-and-add-a-Message#-3-tell-the-va-what-to-say-0-2) provides excellent
step-by-step instructions.

Here is a screenshot of a simple Cognigy.AI Flow:

## Step 3: Create a Cognigy.AI REST Endpoint

<TLDR>

Endpoints are the connector between your user interface and the Cognigy Agent.

The REST Endpoint lets you connect to a Cognigy Flow directly through a REST interface.

- From the [Cognigy.AI documentation](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/endpoints/overview/)

</TLDR>

On your agent dashboard on the Cognigy.AI platform, select `Endpoints` from the `Build` section of the sidebar menu. Click on the button `+ New Endpoint`: this will trigger a configuration menu to open.

Type a name for this Endpoint, select the Flow you previously created in the `Flow` dropdown, select `REST` from the `Endpoint Type` list (scroll down to find the REST type) and click on the `Save` button to save this configuration.

Note down your REST Endpoint URL, you will need it later on for the [step 6](/integrations/cognigy-ai#step-6-option-1-install-and-configure-cognigyai-to-your-airy-instance-via-api-request).

## Step 4: Create an API key

We now need to create an API key in order to use the [Cognigy.AI API](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/developer-guides/using-api/#valid-api-key).

Click on the avatar icon on the navigation menu and select `My Profile` in the dropdown.
On your profile page, scroll down to the API Keys section and click on the `+` icon to generate a new API Key.

Note down your API key, you will need it in the next step.

## Step 5: Find your Cognigy.AI user ID

One way to get your Cognigy.AI user ID is to use the Cognigy.AI API sending a GET request to `/flows`. This request serves the data from the Flow(s) created.

Navigate to the [Cognigy.AI Open API](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi): this interface enables to easily use the Cognigy.AI's RESTful web services.

Paste the API Key you generated in the previous step in the Authentication's API Key input at the top of the page (below `Send api_key in query with the given value`).

Then, scroll down to [GET /flows](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#get-/v2.0/flows) and click on the `TRY` button.

You should get a `200` Response status along with the Flow's data as the response body. The `createdBy` string is your user ID: note it down, you will need it in the next step.

Congratulations! You are now ready to connect Cognigy.AI to your Airy Core instance ðŸŽ‰

## Step 6 (option 1): Install and configure Cognigy.AI to your Airy instance via API request

Send an API request to the [Components Install](/api/endpoints/components#install) endpoint to install Cognigy.AI on your Airy instance.

The request body should be:

```json
{
  "name": "cognigy-connector"
}
```

Once the installation is successful (indicated by a 201 response status code), you can configure the component with the [Components Update](/api/endpoints/components#update) endpoint.

Use the REST Endpoint URL and User ID you got in the previous steps ([step 3](/integrations/cognigy-ai#step-3-create-a-cognigyai-rest-endpoint) and [step 5](/integrations/cognigy-ai#step-5-find-your-cognigyai-user-id)) to compose the request body:

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "cognigy-connector",
      "enabled": true,
      "data": {
        "cognigyRestEndpointURL": "yourRestEndpointUrl",
        "cognigyUserId": "yourUserID"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The request is considered successful if the component's name (in this case: `cognigy-connector`) is returned in the list of configured components.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "cognigy-connector": true
  }
}
```

Cognigy.AI is now installed and configured.

## Step 6 (option 2): Install and configure Cognigy.AI to your Airy instance via the Control Center UI

On the [Airy Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction), navigate to the [Catalog](/ui/control-center/catalog) and select `Cognigy.AI`. Click on the `Install` button.

Once the installation is completed, navigate to the [Control Center's Connectors page](/ui/control-center/connectors) and select Cognigy.AI: this will open the connector's configuration page.

Paste the `REST Endpoint URL` and `User ID` you got in the previous steps ([step 3](/integrations/cognigy-ai#step-3-create-a-cognigyai-rest-endpoint) and [step 5](/integrations/cognigy-ai#step-5-find-your-cognigyai-user-id))
in the respective fields and save this configuration.

Cognigy.AI is now installed and configured.

## Step 7: Cognigy.AI's connection with Airy

To test the connection, write a message to one of your channels: Airy Core will
forward it to your Cognigy.AI installation, which will respond to the Airy Core API according to its conversation [Flow](/integrations/cognigy-ai#step-2-create-a-cognigyai-flow) .

The screenshot below was taken on a [Airy Live Chat Plugin](/sources/chatplugin/overview) channel from an Airy instance connected to Cognigy.AI. It shows an example where a message sent to Airy Core is automatically responded to according to a [Cognigy.AI Flow](/integrations/cognigy-ai#step-2-create-a-cognigyai-flow) where the Live Agent responds "Hi from Cognigy! ðŸ‘‹" to a contact's first message.
