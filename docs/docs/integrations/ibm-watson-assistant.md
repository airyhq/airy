:::tip What you will learn

- Finding your credentials on your IBM Cloud dashboard
- How to connect your IBM Watson Assistant to Airy Core

:::

:::note Prerequisites

- A running Airy Core installation (refer to the [Get
  Started section](getting-started/installation/introduction.md))
- An [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) account with a running [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) product

:::

## Step 1: Find your credentials on your IBM Cloud dashbaord

Once that you have an [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) account with a running [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) (see prerequisites), you need to find your assistant's credentials. Connecting the [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) to Airy Core requires 3 configuration values: your IBM Watson Assistant instance's `URL`, `apiKey` and `Assistant ID`.

- Find your [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) instance's `URL` and `apiKey` on the IBM Watson Assistant service page. To access this service page: select `ressource list` from your dashboard, select the `AI / Machine Learning` category, and then select your assistant. Note down these credentials.

- Next, on your IBM Watson Assistant service page, click on the button `Launch Assistant`: this opens the assistant page. On your assistant page, click on the `settings` button on the left sidebar, at the bottom. This opens the settings page: note the `Assistant ID`.

<br />

Connecting [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) to your Airy Core instance can be done through API request or through the [Airy Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction).

We cover both options in this section: keep reading for connecting [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) via
API request, scroll down to the next section for connecting it via the [Airy Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction).

## Step 2 (option 1): Install and configure IBM Watson Assistant to your Airy instance via API request

Send an API request to the [Components Install](/api/endpoints/components#install) endpoint to install the [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) on your Airy instance.

The request body should be:

```json
{
  "name": "airy-core/ibm-watson-assistant-connector"
}
```

Once the installation is successful, you can configure the component with the [Components Update](/api/endpoints/components#update) endpoint.

Use the `URL`, `apiKey`, and `Assistant ID` you noted in the previous step to compose the request body:

```json
{
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "ibm-watson-assistant-connector",
      "enabled": true,
      "data": {
        "ibmWatsonAssistantURL": "yourURL",
        "ibmWatsonAssistantApiKey": "yourApiKey",
        "ibmWatsonAssistantAssistantId": "yourAssistantId"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

The request is considered successful if `ibm-watson-assistant-connector` is returned in the list of configured components and the request status code is `200`.

```json
{
  "components": {
    "ibm-watson-assistant-connector": true
  }
}
```

The [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) is now installed and configured on your Airy Core instance.

## Step 2 (option 2): Installation and configuration via the Airy Control Center UI

On the [Airy Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction), navigate to the [Catalog](/ui/control-center/catalog) and select `IBM Watson Assistant`. Click on the `Install` button.

Once the installation is completed, navigate to the [Control Center's Connectors page](/ui/control-center/connectors) and select `IBM Watson Assistant`: this will open the connector's configuration page.

Paste the `URL`, `apiKey`, and `Assistant ID` you noted in the previous step in the respective fields and save this configuration.

The [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) is now installed and configured on your Airy Core instance.

## Step 3: IBM Watson Assistant's connection with Airy

To test the connection, write a message to one of your channels: Airy Core will
forward it to your [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) installation, which will respond according to its conversation flow using the Airy Core API.

The screenshot below displays an [Airy Live Chat Plugin](/sources/chatplugin/overview) from an Airy instance connected to the [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant). It shows an example where a message sent to Airy Core is automatically responded to according to the [IBM Watson Assistant](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/watson-assistant) conversation flow where the assistant responds "Hello from IBM Watson Assistant!" to a contact's message.
