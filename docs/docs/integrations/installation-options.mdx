Connecting this [component](/concepts/architecture#components) to your Airy Core instance
can be done in 2 ways:

- through API request (using API platforms such as [Postman](https://www.postman.com/))
- or through the [Airy Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction)

We cover both options in this section: keep reading for connection via API request,
scroll down to the next section for connecting it via the
[Airy Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction).
