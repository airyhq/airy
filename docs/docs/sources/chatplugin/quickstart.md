<TLDR>

In this Quickstart we are **setting up our first source, listen to
conversations, and consume directly from Kafka**

</TLDR>

We are going to use Airy's Live Chat Plugin as our first source. We then use the
plugin to send messages, and check them out in the UI, your terminal and
directly in Apache Kafka.

Airy's Live Chat Plugin can be connected as a source both through API request and through the 
Airy UI. Each step covers both options.

## Step 1: Set up your first source

Once you [signed up](/api/endpoints/users.md#signup), you must [log
in](/api/authentication.md#login) so you can obtain a valid JWT token for the
upcoming API calls:

```sh
token=$(echo $(curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d \
"{ \
\"email\":\"grace@example.com\", \
\"password\":\"the_answer_is_42\" \
}" http://airy.core/users.login) | jq -r '.token')
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -d \
"{
    \"name\": \"chat plugin source\"
}" http://airy.core/channels.chatplugin.connect
```

<img alt="channels_connect" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/connect_chatplugin_channel.gif')} />

The ID from the response is the `channel_id`. It is required for
the next steps, so note it down.

Alternatively, you can connect Airy's Live Chat Plugin via the [UI](ui/introduction). 

On your instance's Airy Core UI, click on 'Channels' on the left sidebar menu and select the Airy Live Chat channel from the list: click on the cross button on the right. Next, click on the blue button "Connect Airy Live Chat". 

Enter a display name and optionally an image url in the respective field. The display name will be used as the name of the conversation; the image url will be used as the image icon of the conversation. If you do not enter an image url, or if it is invalid, a fallback image is used.

An Airy's Live Chat Plugin source will appear as connected in the UI. At any time, you can edit the display name and image url of your channels by clicking on the button showing the 
connected channels.

When you connect an Airy's Live Chat Plugin source through the UI, you can find its `channel_id` by clicking in the Install App tab in the edit channel section. The `channel_id` 
is underlined in the screenshot below. The `channel_id` is required for the next steps, so note it down.

## Step 2: Send messages via the Chat Plugin

Pass the `channel_id` as a query parameter when opening the demo page in your
browser. This authenticates the chat plugin and enables you to send messages
immediately:

```
http://airy.core/chatplugin/ui/example?channel_id=<channel_id>
```

You can now type a message in the text box and send it ðŸŽ‰

## Step 3: Use the HTTP API to list conversations

To see how messages are flowing through the system, [list
conversations](/api/endpoints/conversations.md#list) for the channel you have just
created. it should return the message you have just sent.

<img alt="conversations.list" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/conversation_list.gif')} />

```sh
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -d "{}" \
http://airy.core/conversations.list | jq .
```

## Step 4: Consume directly from Apache Kafka

You can also consume the messages directly from the Kafka
`application.communication.messages` topic:

```
kubectl exec -it kafka-0 -- /bin/bash
kafka-console-consumer \
--bootstrap-server airy-cp-kafka:9092 \
--topic application.communication.messages \
--from-beginning
```
