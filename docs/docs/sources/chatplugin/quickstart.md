<TLDR>

In this Quickstart we are **setting up our first source, listen to
conversations, and consume directly from Kafka**

</TLDR>

We are going to use Airy's Live Chat Plugin as our first source. We then use the
plugin to send messages, and check them out in the [Inbox UI](/ui/inbox/introduction),
your terminal and directly in Apache Kafka.

Airy's Live Chat Plugin can be connected both through API request (using curl or platforms such as Postman) and the [Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction). This document covers both options.

## Step 1: Set up your first source

import ConnectChannelOptions from "../connectChannelOptions.mdx"

<ConnectChannelOptions />

## Connect Airy Live Chat Plugin via API request

You can use curl or a platform such as Postman to send a request to the [Channels endpoint](/api/endpoints/channels#google).

<ButtonBox
icon={<BoltSVG />}
title='Channels endpoint'
description="Connect an Airy Live Chat Plugin channel to your Airy Core instance through the Channels endpoint"
link='api/endpoints/channels#google'
/>

<br />

import ConnectChatPlugin from '../../api/endpoints/connect-chatPlugin.mdx'

<ConnectChatPlugin />

```shell script
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d \
"{
    \"name\": \"chat plugin source\"
}" http://localhost/channels.chatplugin.connect
```

<img alt="channels_connect" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/connect_chatplugin_channel.gif')} />

The ID from the response is the `channel_id`. It is required for
the next steps, so note it down.

## Connect Airy Live Chat Plugin via the UI

Alternatively, you can connect Airy's Live Chat Plugin channel via the [Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction).

On your instance's [Control Center](/ui/control-center/introduction), click on the 'Catalog' icon on the left sidebar menu and select 'Airy Live Chat'.

This will open a page with a form.

<img alt="chat plugin channels UI" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/chatpluginConnectForm.png')} />

<ConnectFormOptional />

import ConnectFormOptional from '../connectFormOptional.mdx'

Next, click on the 'Save' button.

Upon successful connection, Airy Live Chat Plugin will appear as connected in the [Connectors](/ui/control-center/connectors) page in the [Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction).

<img alt="Control Center connectors" src={useBaseUrl('img/ui/controlCenterConnectors.png')} />

On the [Connectors](/ui/control-center/connectors) page, select 'Airy Live Chat'.

This will bring you to a page where you can edit or disconnect all Airy Live Chat Plugin channels that have been connected.

<img alt="chat plugin channels UI" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/chatplugin-channel-connected.png')} />

Select the channel you just connected and click on 'Edit'.

This will bring you to a page where you can manage the installation and settings of the channel.

<img alt="chat plugin channels UI" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/chatplugin-id.png')} />

Click on the 'Install app' tab. Here you will find the `channel_id`, which is located in the sample code (highlighted in the screenshot above). It is required for the next steps, so note it down.

## Step 2: Send messages via the Chat Plugin

Pass the `channel_id` as a query parameter when opening the demo page in your
browser. This authenticates the chat plugin and enables you to send messages
immediately:

```
http://localhost/chatplugin/ui/example?channel_id=<channel_id>
```

You can now type a message in the text box and send it ðŸŽ‰

<img alt="chatplugin working" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/chatplugin.gif')} />

## Step 3: Use the HTTP API to list conversations

To see how messages are flowing through the system, [list
conversations](/api/endpoints/conversations.md#list) for the channel you have just
created. it should return the message you have just sent.

<img alt="conversations.list" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/conversation_list.gif')} />

<br />

```sh
curl -XPOST http://localhost/conversations.list | jq .
```

The [Inbox UI](/ui/inbox/introduction) lists all your [conversations](/getting-started/glossary/#conversation), across all [sources](/getting-started/glossary/#source).

The screenshot below shows a conversation list in the [Inbox UI's messenger](/ui/inbox/messenger). In this example, all the [conversations](/getting-started/glossary/#conversation) have been created by connecting an Airy Live Chat [channel](/getting-started/glossary/#channel) to an Airy Core instance.

Each time you connect a new [channel](/getting-started/glossary/#channel), a new [conversation](/getting-started/glossary/#conversation) is created and added in the [Inbox UI's messenger](/ui/inbox/messenger). You can then use it to respond to [messages](/getting-started/glossary/#message).

<img alt="conversations list UI" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/chatplugin-conversations.png')} />

## Step 4: Consume directly from Apache Kafka

You can also consume the messages directly from the Kafka
`application.communication.messages` topic:

```
kubectl exec -it kafka-0 -- /bin/bash
kafka-console-consumer.sh \
--bootstrap-server kafka:9092 \
--topic application.communication.messages \
--from-beginning
```

<img alt="Kafka Topic"
src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/chatplugin/messages_topic.gif')} />
