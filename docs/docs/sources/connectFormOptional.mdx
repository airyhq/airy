You can optionally add a name and an image. The display name will be used as the [conversation](/getting-started/glossary/#conversation)'s name while the image URL will be used as its icon in the [Inbox UI's messenger](/ui/inbox/messenger). A fallback image will be used if you do not enter a valid image URL.
