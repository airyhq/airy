This document provides a step by step guide to integrate Facebook with your Airy
Core Platform instance.

:::tip What you will learn

- The required steps to configure the Facebook source
- How to connect a Facebook page to Airy Core

:::

## Configuration

The Facebook source requires the following configuration:

- An app id and an app secret so that the platform can send messages back via
  your Facebook application
- A webhook integration so that the platform can ingest messages from your
  Facebook pages
- A page token for each facebook page you intend to integrate

Let's proceed step by step.

### Find the app id and secret

To connect a page, you must have an approved Facebook app. If you don't have
one, you must to create it before proceeding. Once you are done with the
configuration, you should see something like this:

<img alt="Facebook apps page" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/facebook/apps.jpg')} />

Note down the `App ID` of your Facebook application and then head to the basic
settings page. Here you will find your `App Secret`:

<img alt="Facebook apps page" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/facebook/secret.png')} />

Now you can use the app id and the app secret for the following environment variables:

- `FACEBOOK_APP_ID`
- `FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET`

:::note

Refer to the [test](getting-started/deployment/vagrant.md#connect-sources) guide
or the [production](getting-started/deployment/production.md#connect-sources)
one to set these variables in your Airy Core instance.

:::

### Configure the webhook integration

For Facebook to start sending events to your running instance, it must first
verify your integration with a challenge. To verify your Facebook webhook
integration, you must set the environment variable `FACEBOOK_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to
a value of your choice.

:::note

Refer to the [test](/getting-started/deployment/vagrant.md#connect-sources)
guide or the
[production](/getting-started/deployment/production.md#connect-sources) one to
set these variables in your Airy Core instance.

:::

Then you are ready to configure the webhook integration. Head to the dashboard
of your Facebook application, find the "Webhooks" link on the left menu and then
click on "Edit subscription". You will see something like this:

<img alt="Facebook edit subscription" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/facebook/webhook.png')} />

Once the verification process has been completed, Facebook will immediately
start sending events to your Airy Core instance.

### Obtain a page token

The next step is to obtain a page token, so that Airy Core can send messages on
behalf of your page. The fastest way to get one is to use the graph explorer
that Facebook provides [Graph
Explorer](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/explorer/).

On the `User or Page` option, select `Get Page Token` and click on `Generate Access Token`:

<img alt="Facebook token page" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/facebook/token.jpg')} />

You're now ready to connect a Facebook page to your Airy Core instace ðŸŽ‰.

## Connect

Connects a Facebook page to Airy Core.

```
POST /facebook.connect
```

- `page_id` is the Facebook page id
- `page_token` is the page Access Token
- `name` Custom name for the connected page
- `image_url` Custom image URL

**Sample request**

```json5
{
  "page_id": "fb-page-id-1",
  "page_token": "authentication token",
  "name": "My custom name for this page",
  "image_url": "https://example.org/custom-image.jpg" // optional
}
```

**Sample response**

```json5
{
  "id": "channel-uuid-1",
  "name": "My custom name for this page",
  "image_url": "https://example.org/custom-image.jpg",
  "source": "facebook",
  "source_channel_id": "fb-page-id-1"
}
```

## Disconnect

Disconnects a Facebook page from Airy Core

```
POST /facebook.disconnect
```

import ChannelDisconnect from './channel-disconnect.mdx'

<ChannelDisconnect />

## Explore

`POST /facebook.explore`

A synchronous endpoint that makes a request to Facebook
to list the available Facebook pages. Some of those pages may already
be connected, which is accounted for in the boolean field `connected`. Due to
the nature of the request, the response time may vary.

**Sample request**

```json5
{
  "auth_token": "authentication token"
}
```

**Sample response**

```json5
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "my page 1",
      "page_id": "fb-page-id-1",
      "connected": false,
      "image_url": "http://example.org/avatar.jpeg" // optional
    },
    {
      "name": "my page 2",
      "page_id": "fb-page-id-2",
      "connected": true
    }
  ]
}
```
