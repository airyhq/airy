Google's Business Messages source provides a channel of communication between your Google
Business Location and your running instance of Airy Core.

## Configuration

Google's Business Messages requires the following configuration:

- [Step 1: Registration](#step-1-registration)
- [Step 2: Editing of the yaml file in Airy Core](#step-2-editing-of-the-yaml-file-in-airy-core)
- [Step 3: Verification by Google](#step-3-verification-by-google)

Let's proceed step by step.

## Step 1: Registration

You first need to be registered with Google's Business Messages before configuring this source. Refer to [Google's Business Messages' guides](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides) to find more information about this source and the registration process.

## Step 2: Editing of the yaml file in Airy Core

Once you are registered, head over to your Google Service Account and create a key in json format.

Copy the Google Service Account key file provided by Google to
`infrastructure/airy.yaml` as a one line string, below `sources/google`:

```
GOOGLE_SA_FILE=<CONTENT OF THE FILE>
```

## Step 3: Verification by Google

As a security measure, every request sent by Google is signed and verified
against your partner key. You must also set the environment variable
`GOOGLE_PARTNER_KEY` to your partner key.

Once the verification process has been completed, Google's Business Messages will immediately start sending events to your Airy Core instance ðŸŽ‰

## Connecting Google's Business Messages to your Airy Core instance

After the configuration, you can connect Google's Business Messages source to your instance by sending a request to the [Channels endpoint](/api/endpoints/channels#google).

<ButtonBox

title='Channels endpoint'
description="Connect Google's Business Messages source to your Airy Core instance through the Channels endpoint"
link='api/endpoints/channels#google'
/>

<br/>

import ConnectGoogle from '../api/endpoints/connect-google.mdx'

<ConnectGoogle />

## Send messages from Google's Business Messages source

After connecting the source to your instance, you will be able to send messages through the [Messages endpoint](/api/endpoints/messages#send).

<ButtonBox
icon={<BoltSVG />}
title='Messages endpoint'
description="Send messages to your Airy Core instance from Google's Business Messages through the Messages endpoint"
link='api/endpoints/messages#send-from-googles-business-messages-source'
/>

<br />

import GoogleMessagesSend from '../api/endpoints/google-messages-send.mdx'

<GoogleMessagesSend />

## Send and receive messages with the Inbox UI
