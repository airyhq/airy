Google's Business Messages source provides a channel of communication between your Google
Business Location and your running instance of Airy Core.

:::tip What you will learn

- The required steps to configure Google's Business Messages source
- How to connect a Google Business Location to Airy Core

:::

## Configuration

Google's Business Messages requires the following configuration:

- [Step 1: Registration](#step-1-registration)
- [Step 2: Editing of the yaml file in Airy Core](#step-2-editing-of-the-yaml-file-in-airy-core)
- [Step 3: Verification by Google](#step-3-verification-by-google)

Let's proceed step by step.

## Step 1: Registration

You first need to be registered with Google's Business Messages before configuring this source. You can find more information about Google's Business Messages and the registration process [here](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides).

## Step 2: Editing of the yaml file in Airy Core

Once you are registered, head over to your Google Service Account and create a key in json format.

Copy the Google Service Account key file provided by Google to
`infrastructure/airy.yaml` as a one line string, below `sources/google`:

```
GOOGLE_SA_FILE=<CONTENT OF THE FILE>
```

## Step 3: Verification by Google

As a security measure, every request sent by Google is signed and verified
against your partner key. You must also set the environment variable
`GOOGLE_PARTNER_KEY` to your partner key.

Once the verification process has been completed, Google's Business Messages will immediately start sending events to your Airy Core instance ðŸŽ‰

</SuccessBox>

## Connecting Google's Business Messages to your Airy Core instance

After the configuration, you can connect Google's Business Messages source to your instance by sending a request to the [Channels endpoint](/api/endpoints/channels#google).

<ButtonBox
icon={() => <BoltSVG />}
title='Channels endpoint'
description="Connect Google's Business Messages source to your Airy Core instance through the Channels endpoint"
link='api/endpoints/channels#google'
/>

<br/>

import ConnectGoogle from '../api/endpoints/connect-google.mdx'

<ConnectGoogle />

## Send messages from Google's Business Messages source

After connecting the source to your instance, you will be able to send messages through the [Messages endpoint](/api/endpoints/messages#send).

<ButtonBox
icon={() => <BoltSVG />}
title='Messages endpoint'
description="Send messages to your Airy Core instance from Google's Business Messages through the Messages endpoint"
link='api/endpoints/messages#send'
/>

<br />

`POST /messages.send`

Sends a message to a conversation and returns a payload. Whatever is put on the
`message` field will be forwarded "as-is" to the source's message endpoint.

**Sending a text message**

```json5
{
  "conversation_id": "a688d36c-a85e-44af-bc02-4248c2c97622",
  "message": {
    "text": "Hello World Agent!",
    "representative": {
      "displayName": "Hello World from Agent",
      "representativeType": "HUMAN"
    }
  }
}
```

**Sample response**

```json5
{
  "id": "{UUID}",
  "content": '{"text":"Hello"}',
  "state": "pending|failed|delivered",
  "sender_type": "{string/enum}",
  // See glossary
  "sent_at": "{string}",
  //'yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ' date in UTC form, to be localized by clients
  "source": "{String}",
  // one of the possible sources
  "metadata": {
    "sentFrom": "iPhone"
  }
  // metadata object of the message
}
```

## Send and receive messages with the Inbox UI

Now that you connected Google's Business Messages to your instance and started a conversation, you can see the conversations, messages in the [Airy Inbox](/apps/ui/inbox), and use it to respond to the messages.

The [Inbox's UI](/apps/ui/inbox) is able render the messages types you can send from Google's Business Messages, such as Rich Cards or Suggestions.

<ButtonBox
icon={() => <InboxSVG />}
title='Inbox'
description="Receive messages from Google's Business Messages and send messages using the Inbox UI"
link='apps/ui/inbox'
/>
