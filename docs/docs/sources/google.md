Google's Business Messages source provides a channel of communication between your Google
Business Location and your running instance of Airy Core.

:::tip What you will learn

- The required steps to configure Google's Business Messages source
- How to connect a Google Business Location to Airy Core

:::note

The Google's Business Messages source is not enabled by default.

You need to add configuration in your airy.yaml file and apply it to activate it.

## Configuration

Google's Business Messages requires the following configuration:

- [Configuration](#configuration)
  - [Step 1: Registration](#step-1-registration)
  - [Step 2: Editing of the yaml file in Airy Core](#step-2-editing-of-the-yaml-file-in-airy-core)
  - [Step 3: Verification by Google](#step-3-verification-by-google)
- [Connecting Google's Business Messages to your Airy Core instance](#connecting-googles-business-messages-to-your-airy-core-instance)
- [Send messages from Google's Business Messages source](#send-messages-from-googles-business-messages-source)

Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Registration

You first need to be registered with Google's Business Messages before
configuring this source. Refer to [Google's Business Messages
guides](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides)
to find more information about this source and the registration process.

### Step 2: Editing of the yaml file in Airy Core

Once you are registered, head over to your Google Service Account and create a key in json format.

<img alt="Facebook token page" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/google/key.png')} />

Copy the Google Service Account key file provided by Google to
your `airy.yaml` file as a one line string next to `saFile:` (below `components/sources/google`).

### Step 3: Verification by Google

As a security measure, every request sent by Google is signed and verified
against your partner key. You must also set the value for `partnerKey:` to your partner key,
in your `airy.yaml` file, below `components/sources/google`.

import ApplyVariablesNote from './applyVariables-note.mdx'

<ApplyVariablesNote />

:::note

Your Google Webhook URL should have the following format:

```
https://your-public-fqdn/google
```

or if you are using Ngrok:

```
https://RANDOM_STRING.tunnel.airy.co/google
```

:::

<SuccessBox>

Once the verification process has been completed, Google's Business Messages will immediately start sending events to your Airy Core instance ðŸŽ‰

</SuccessBox>

## Connecting Google's Business Messages to your Airy Core instance

After the configuration, you can connect a Google's Business Messages source to your instance by sending a request to the [Channels endpoint](/api/endpoints/channels#google).

<ButtonBox
icon={<BoltSVG />}
title='Channels endpoint'
description="Connect Google's Business Messages source to your Airy Core instance through the Channels endpoint"
link='api/endpoints/channels#google'
/>

<br/>

import ConnectGoogle from '../api/endpoints/connect-google.mdx'

<ConnectGoogle />

## Send messages from Google's Business Messages source

After connecting the source to your instance, you will be able to send messages through the [Messages endpoint](/api/endpoints/messages#send).

Note that when you send a message from this source, you must specify a representative, the individual or automation that composed the message.
Google's Business Messages supports "BOT" and "HUMAN" as the `representativeType`. Find more information on [Google's Business Messages guide](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/build/send).

Whatever is put on the `message` field will be forwarded "as-is" to the source's message endpoint.

**Sending a text message**

```json5
{
  conversation_id: "a688d36c-a85e-44af-bc02-4248c2c97622",
  message: {
    text: "Hello!",
    representative: {
      representativeType: "HUMAN"
    }
  }
}
```

**Sample response**

```json5
{
  "id": "{UUID}",
  "content": {
    "text": "Hello!",
    "representative": {
      "representativeType": "HUMAN"
    }
  },
  "delivery_state": "pending|failed|delivered",
  // See glossary
  "from_contact": "true|false",
  //'yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ' date in UTC form, to be localized by clients
  "sent_at": "{string}",
  "source": "google",
  // metadata object of the message
  "metadata": {
    "sentFrom": "iPhone"
  },
  // details about the sender
  "sender": {
    "id": "github:12345", // For unauthenticated instances this defaults to "airy-core-anonymous"
    "name": "John Doe", // optional
    "avatar_url": "http://example.org/avatar.png" // optional
  }
}
```
