The Google source provides a channel of communication between your Google
Business Location and your running instance of the Airy Core Platform.

:::tip What you will learn

- The required steps to configure the Google source
- How to connect a Google Business Location to the Airy core Platform

:::

## Configuration

The first step is to copy the Google Service Account file provided by Google to
`infrastructure/airy.conf` as a one line string

```
GOOGLE_SA_FILE=<CONTENT OF THE FILE>
```

As a security measure, every request sent by Google is signed and verified
against your partner key. You must also set the environment variable
`GOOGLE_PARTNER_KEY` to your partner key

Once the verification process has been completed, Google will immediately start
sending events to your Airy Core Platform instance.

## Connect a channel

Connects a Google Business Account to the Airy Core Platform.

```
POST /channels.connect
```

- `source` _must_ be `google`
- `source_channel_id` The id of your Google Business Message [agent](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/reference/business-communications/rest/v1/brands.agents#Agent).
- `token` leave empty. To allow authentication you must provide a [Google service account key file](https://developers.google.com/business-communications/business-messages/guides/quickstarts/prerequisite-setup) in your runtime configuration.
