## Send and receive messages with the Inbox UI

Now that you connected this source to your instance and started a conversation,
you can see the conversations, messages, and templates in the [Airy Inbox](/apps/ui/inbox),
and use it to respond to the messages.

<ButtonBox
  icon={() => <InboxSVG />}
  title="Inbox"
  description="Receive messages from different sources and send messages using the Inbox UI"
  link="apps/ui/inbox"
/>
