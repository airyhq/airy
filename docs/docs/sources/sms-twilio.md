You need to add configuration in your airy.yaml file and apply it to activate it.

import TwilioConfig from './twilio-config.mdx'

<TwilioConfig />

## Step 1: Configuration

import TwilioSources from './twilio-sources.mdx'

<TwilioSources />

<SuccessBox>

Success! You are now ready to connect a Twilio.SMS source to your Airy Core instance ðŸŽ‰

</SuccessBox>

## Step 2: Connect a Twilio provider to your instance

import ConnectChannelOptions from "./connectChannelOptions.mdx"

<ConnectChannelOptions />

## Connect Twilio.SMS via API request

You connect connect a Twilio.SMS channel by sending a request to the Channels endpoint.

<ButtonBox
icon={() => <BoltSVG />}
title='Channels endpoint'
description='Connect a Twilio SMS source to your Airy Core instance through the Channels endpoint'
link='api/endpoints/channels#sms'
/>

<br />

<ConnectTwilioSms />

import ConnectTwilioSms from '../api/endpoints/connect-twilioSms.mdx'

## Connect Twilio.SMS via the UI

You can connect a Twilio.SMS channel via your Airy Core instance [Control Center UI](/ui/control-center/introduction).

Make sure the variables have been successfully applied to your instance, otherwise you won't be able to connect the Twilio SMS channel through the UI.

<ApplyVariablesNote />

import ApplyVariablesNote from './applyVariables-note.mdx'

On your instance's [Control Center](/ui/control-center/introduction), click on 'Catalog' on the left sidebar menu and select 'SMS'.

This will open a page with a form.

<img alt="TwilioSMS connect" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/twilio/twilioSMS_ui.png')} />

Add your Twilio phone number in the Twilio Phone Number field.

<ConnectFormOptional />

import ConnectFormOptional from './connectFormOptional.mdx'

Upon successful connection, Twilio SMS will appear as connected in the [Connectors](/ui/control-center/connectors) page in your app's [Control Center](/ui/control-center/introduction).

You can edit its configuration at any time by selecting 'SMS' in the list.

## Step 3: Send and receive messages with the Inbox UI

After connecting the source to your instance, it's time to create a conversation between your
Airy Core instance, and a Twilio.SMS source.

Send a text message (SMS) from a mobile phone to the Twilio phone number you have used.
This will create a conversation: a Twilio.SMS conversation will appear instantly in the [Inbox UI's messenger](/ui/inbox/messenger) with the text message you have sent.
