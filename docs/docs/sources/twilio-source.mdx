## Configuration

The Twilio source requires the following configuration:

- [Configuration](#configuration)
  - [Step 1: Find the authToken and accountSid](#step-1-find-the-authToken-and-accountSid)
  - [Step 2: Configure the webhook integration](#step-2-configure-the-webhook-integration)
- [Connect a Twilio source to your instance](#connect-a-twilio-source-to-your-instance)
- [Send messages from a Twilio source](#send-messages-from-a-twilio-source)
- [Send and receive messages with the Inbox UI](#send-and-receive-messages-with-the-inbox-ui)

Let's proceed step by step.

### Step 1: Find the authToken and accountSid

To connect a TWilio source you must have a Twilio account and a bought phone number. If you don't have one, head to Twilio's website: create an account
and buy a phone number.

Once you have a Twilio account, log in, and find your [Twilio auth
token account SID](https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223136027-Auth-Tokens-and-How-to-Change-Them)
on your Twilio dashboard (underlined in red in the screenshot below).

```
https://www.twilio.com/console
```

<img alt="Twilio token" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/twilio/twilio_token.png')} />

Copy and paste your Auth token and Account Sid as strings below `sources/twilio` in `infrastructure/airy.yaml`.
Make sure the Auth token and Account Sid are contain within a pair of either single quotation marks '' or double quotation marks "".

```
twilio:
authToken=<YOUR AUTH TOKEN>
accountSid=<YOUR ACCOUNT SID>
```

:::note

Refer to the [Configuration
Docs](/getting-started/installation/configuration.md#components) on how to input
these values.

Refer to the [test](getting-started/installation/minikube.md#connect-sources)
guide or the
[production](getting-started/installation/production.md#connect-sources) one to
set these variables in your Airy Core instance.

:::

### Step 2: Configure the webhook integration

Once you have edited the `airy.yaml`, create an [Airy Core instance]
(/getting-started/installation/Minikube). Once you have successfully created an Airy Core instance, you are ready to configure
the webhook.

On the Twilio dashboard, open the left menu sidebar and
go to the Phone numbers section. Copy and paste your Twilio Webhook URL as the incoming Webhook url of your phone number (below 'A MESSAGE
COMES IN').

```
https://www.twilio.com/console/phone-numbers
```

<img alt="Twilio webhook" src={useBaseUrl('img/sources/twilio/twilio_webhook.png')} />

<br />
<br />

:::note

Your Twilio Webhook URL should have the following format:

```
`https://RANDOM_STRING.tunnel.airy.co/twilio`
```

Refer to [the section on public webhooks](/getting-started/installation/minikube#public-webhooks) for information about how to find your Facebook Webhook URL.
