The Catalog page of the [Control Center](/ui/control-center/introduction) lists both the [connectors](/connectors/sources/introduction) that have been installed and those that are not installed.

In the Catalog 'Not Installed' list, you can choose which connector you want to add and configure it easily (see [Configuration](catalog#configuration) below).

A connector is listed in the [Connectors](connectors) page once it has been successfully connected.

## Example

The screenshots below come from a sample Airy Core app's Control Center UI.

The Catalog shows that the app is already connected to the [Airy Live Chat](/connectors/sources/chatplugin/quickstart), [Facebook Messenger](/connectors/sources/facebook), [WhatsApp](/connectors/sources/whatsapp-twilio), [Google Business Messages](/connectors/sources/google), and [Instagram](/connectors/sources/instagram) connectors. The [SMS](/connectors/sources/sms-twilio) connector hasn't been installed yet and is available to connect.
