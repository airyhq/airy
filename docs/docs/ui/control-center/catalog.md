The Catalog page of the [Control Center](/ui/control-center/introduction) lists the available [connectors](/sources/introduction) that can be connected to an Airy Core app. You can choose which connector you want to add and configure it easily (see [Configuration](catalog#configuration) below).

A connector is listed in the [Connectors](connectors) page once it has been successfully connected.

## Example

The screenshots below come from a sample Airy Core app. Its Control Center UI show that the app is already connected to the [Airy Live Chat](/sources/chatplugin/quickstart), [Facebook Messenger](/sources/facebook), [WhatsApp](/sources/whatsapp-twilio), [Google Business Messages](/sources/google), and [Instagram](/sources/instagram) connectors. The [SMS](/sources/sms-twilio) connector is listed in the Catalog: it hasn't been added to the app yet and is available to connect.
