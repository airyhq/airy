On the Connectors page of the [Control Center](/ui/control-center/introduction), you can view your app's [connectors](/connectors/sources/introduction) and edit their [configuration](catalog#configuration).

A connector is listed in this page once it has been successfully connected through the [Catalog](catalog).
