The Status section of the [Control Center](/ui/control-center/introduction) provides a high-level overview of all your Airy Core app's [components](/getting-started/components) and their status. It also allows you to enable [components](/getting-started/components) through a toggle and see their status change in real time.

The data displayed in this comprehensible table is served by the [client.config endpoint](/api/endpoints/client-config).
