<TLDR> Suggested Replies allow you to add predefined responses to conversation messages, thus improving the response time and the overall communication experience.</TLDR>

Suggested Replies are text replies that you can add to any message via the HTTP API. The suggested replies of the last 5 messages of a given conversation are considered for suggestion.

As soon as suggested replies have been successfully added to a message (i.e. the API request returned a 200 response), a Suggestions button appears at the top left of the input in the messages list of the conversation's UI, enabling the user to choose a suggested reply as an answer.

The screenshot below shows a sample conversation in the UI of an Airy Core instance: two suggested replies have been added to the contact's last message ('Great that it worked. Is there anything else you need?' and 'Have a nice day!'). The user clicks on the Suggestions button at the top left of the conversation's input and selects the suggested reply 'Have a nice day!'.

## Integration with Rasa for further message automation

You can integrate the open-source machine learning framework Rasa to automate sending messages on your Airy Core instance.
