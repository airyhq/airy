This is a textarea input component. It accepts the same parameters
as the `Input` component and acts the same way with validations.

The textarea will automatically grow the height based on the content
inside of it.

```jsx
<TextArea label="Long Text" placeholder="Enter a book here" hint="Homer, is this you?"/>
```
